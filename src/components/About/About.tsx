        Hello! My name is Bella and I am from Boulder, Colorado. I am an introvert at heart but with some extroverted qualities. I love to meet new people and take risks: Whether it be through learning new things, pushing myself outside of my comfort zone or challenging myself to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I absolutely love learning new skills and challenging myself in
        different respects. To learn more about what I've been working on, feel
        free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/wderocco8">GitHub</a>{" "}
